## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can predict house prices with good accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical house prices along with their corresponding features. We will experiment with various machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It consists of a CSV file containing house features and their corresponding prices. The features include attributes like location, number of bedrooms, area, etc. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning models.


## Usage

Before running any scripts, make sure you have set up the necessary environment and installed the required dependencies. You can then proceed with the following steps:

1. Explore the dataset and preprocess it if required.
2. Train the machine learning models using the training data.
3. Evaluate the trained models on the testing data.
4. Make predictions using the best-performing model.
